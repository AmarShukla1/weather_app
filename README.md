# Asynchronous js practice.

Although I have studied about callbacks promises and then async-await learnt about fetch,then callback hell,chaining promises I have forgot a lot and also programmers forget their code after 6 months lol.

So I am making a project that is mentioned in odin webdev.


UPDATE:
So i relearnt about promises and callbacks.Also i learnt about how javascript works by watching what the heck is an event loop anyway.Literally cleared my concepts.

Now just building a dummy project that is based on giphy api.Did that using promises as well as async-await

UPDATE:

Now built weather app after learning about all asynchronous js.

# Asynchronous js practice.

Although I have studied about callbacks promises and then async-await learnt about fetch,then callback hell,chaining promises I have forgot a lot and also programmers forget their code after 6 months lol.

So I am making a project that is mentioned in odin webdev.


UPDATE:
So i relearnt about promises and callbacks.Also i learnt about how javascript works by watching what the heck is an event loop anyway.In that its explained apart from the V8 engine which contains the heap and the call stack there are web apis,the task queue and event loop.Literally cleared my concepts.

Now just building a dummy project that is based on giphy api.Did that using promises as well as async-await

UPDATE:

Now built weather app after learning about all asynchronous js.
